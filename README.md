# Xero API client for node

A minimal client for making requests to the Xero API. Basically just sets up everything you need to use the API in a
RESTful manner, using Javascript objects. It handles OAuth and serialising your request objects as XML.

Currently in the process of adapting to use mashape-oauth.
